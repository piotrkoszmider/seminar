  <strong> Previous talks this semester: </strong><br>
<p>
<br>
<strong>January 29th, 2015, Omar Selim (USP) - 11<sup>15</sup> room 105:</strong>
<p>
<strong>Title: An abstract version of Choquet's theorem</strong><br>
Abstract: I will discuss an abstract version of Choquet’s theorem
concerning the existence of Borel measures that are realised by
capacities of infinite order. The version stated here concerns only
Boolean algebras and the classical result concerning particular
locally compact topological spaces follows. I will also discuss some
possible applications.

<strong></strong><br>
<p>

<strong>November 27th, Grzegorz Plebanek (Wroc&#322;aw) - 11<sup>15</sup> room 105:</strong>
<p>

<strong>Title: Weak* separability in C(K)*</strong><br>
Abstract: The plan is to recall some older results on weak* separability 
in the spaces of the form C(K)* as well as a recent result due to Aviles, Rodriguez and myself:

There is  a compact space K such that the space C(K)* is weak* separable but its  unit ball is not.

(Talagrand's construction of such a space K required CH, ours is in ZFC). 
Finally,  we shall discuss a related open problem on the  Baire measurability of the ball in C(K).

<strong>November 20th, Leandro Candido (IMPAN/USP) - 11<sup>15</sup> room 105:</strong>
<p>
<strong>Some Banach spaces satisfying a pointwise chain condition in the weak topology</strong><br>
Abstract:  The talk is about  a ZFC example by Dow, H. Junilla and J. Pelant of a Banach space C(K), K scattered of countable height, such that
every linear bounded operator from C(K) into c<sub>0</sub>(&omega;<sub>1</sub>) has separable range.
These are  examples 2.15 and 2.16 of  Dow, A.; Junnila, H.; Pelant, J. Chain conditions and weak topologies. Topology Appl. 156 (2009), no. 7, 1327-1344.
<br>
This should be compared with a result of Todorcevic which says that under Martin's Maximum
every Banach space of density &omega;<sub>1</sub> admits a bounded linear operator into c<sub>0</sub>(&omega;<sub>1</sub>)
with nonseparable range. This is subsequently used by Todorcevic to prove that MM implies that every nonseparable
Banach space has an uncountable biorthogonal system and that every Banach space of density &omega;<sub>1</sub> has a separable quotient.

<strong>November 13th, Michal Doucha (IMPAN/IMPACT) - 11<sup>15</sup> room 105:</strong>
<p>
<strong>Introduction to Lipschitz-free Banach spaces</strong><br>

Abstract:  Lipschitz-free spaces are Banach spaces constructed from metric spaces which are characterized by the universal 
property that Lipschitz maps from the starting metric space into some Banach space uniquely 
extend into linear operators with the same Lipschitz constant. 
Their norm is a variant of the Kantorovich transportation distance 
which is a concept that penetrated many areas of mathematics. 
Alternatively, one can view them as certain preduals of Banach spaces of real-valued Lipschitz functions on metric spaces.

I will present both of these views and show their equivalence. 
Then I will proceed to basic properties of these spaces and show some examples.
Finally, I will focus on problems that people have been recently studying on these spaces, 
namely approximation properties of these spaces. That is related to the problem of linear extension of Lipschitz maps on metric spaces.

<strong>November 6th, Micha&#322; &#346;wi&#281;tek (Ph. D. student UJ/WCMCS-IM PAN) - 11<sup>15</sup> room 105:</strong>
<p>
<strong>Continuation of the talk of 23.10.2014.</strong>
<p>
<br>
<strong>October 30th - Marek Cuth (WCMCS-IM PAN) - 11<sup>15</sup> room 105:</strong>
<p>
<strong>Elementary submodels in Banach space theory</strong><br>
Abstract:  The method of elementary submodels can be viewed as a
 tool of set theory which enables us to handle very complicated inductive constructions.
 I will present how elementary submodels can be used in Banach space theory. 
More precisely: in 1993 Argyros and Mercourakis introduced a class of Banach spaces called 
weakly Lindelof determined (WLD). It appeared that this class of WLD Banach spaces 
has many nice properties and it is possible to find nice characterizations of it. 
I will present how elementary submodels
 can be used in order to prove some of those characterizations and prove a
 characterization of WLD spaces in terms of elementary submodels.

<br>

<strong>October 23rd, Micha&#322; &#346;wi&#281;tek  (Ph. D. student UJ/WCMCS-IM PAN) - 11<sup>15</sup> room 105:</strong>
<p>
<strong>Exotic Banach spaces via Boolean algebras and Stone spaces</strong><br>
Abstract: One of the oldest questions in the theory of Banach spaces was
 whether every Banach space is isomorphic to its hyperplanes.
 This was answered negatively by Gowers and Mauray.
During my talk I will present a construction of a 
classical C(K) space, based on the paper Piotr Koszmider, Banach spaces of continuous functions with few operators.
 Math. Ann. 330 (2004), no. 1, 151–183, which also answers the above question negatively.

<strong>October 16th, Gabriel Salazar (IMPAN) - 11<sup>15</sup> room 105:</strong>
<p>
<strong>Some Applications of Shelah's Black Box</strong><br>
Abstract:Shelah’s Black Box is a combinatorial principle that allows us
 to partially predict a given map under specific cardinal conditions. 
Very roughly speaking, if you can get a result using Jensen’s Diamond 
Principle then you can get a weak version of it in ZFC using the Black Box. 
In this talk I will present some algebraic constructions realized by means of this principle, 
focusing in the combinatorial aspect behind them.

<strong>Time and place:</strong> Thursdays  11.15-13.00 am,  room 105, Sniadeckich 8<p>
<p>
               <strong>The scope of the seminar: </strong>
Set-theoretic combinatorial and topological  methods in diverse fields of mathematics, with a special emphasis on abstract analysis like
  Banach spaces, Banach algebras, C*-algebras, Here we include both the developing of such methods as 
forcing, descriptive set theory, Ramsey theory as well as their concrete applications in the fields mentioned above.
<p>

<strong>Working group style: </strong> We will make efforts so that this seminar has
 more a working character rather than the presentation style. This means that we encourage long digressions,
 discussions, background preparations and participation of everyone. 
 We would like to immerse ourselves into the details of the mathematical arguments studied. 
Also the talks are usualy  devoted to research in progress or fascinating results leading to some project not yet resolved.
While ready final results could be presented at other seminars at IM PAN or UW.
