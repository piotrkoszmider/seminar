<strong>Exceptional time and room: 12.06.2015 at 9.30 room 106.<br><p>
 Michal Doucha (IMPACT/IM PAN):   On group C*-algebras
</strong>
<br><p>

<strong>Abstract:</strong> 
I will try to give an idea why people study group C*-algebras 
and what the connection between them and unitary group representations is. I will present two main constructions
<ul>
<li> the construction of a reduced group C*-algebra

<li> the construction of a full group C*-algebra
</ul>

One of rather easy but interesting observations will be that the full group algebra C*(F_infty) 
of the free group of countably many generators is a projectively universal separable C*-algebra;
 i.e. for every separable C*-algebra B there is a *-morphism from C*(F_infty) onto B.

Then depending on the interest, I can try to show that in the case of amenable groups these two constructions lead to the same object.

I will focus mostly on discrete groups but I will sketch how everything works as well for non-discrete locally compact groups.

<strong>21.05.2015 at 11.15 room 105.<br><p>
 Marcin Sabok (McGill/IM PAN): On the non-separability of the space of n-dimensional operator spaces for n>2
</strong>
<br><p>

<strong>Abstract:</strong> We will discuss the argument of Junge and Pisier from the article: 
Bilinear forms on exact operator spaces and B(H)&otimes;B(H), Geometric & Functional Analysis GAFA, 1995, Volume 5, Issue 2, pp 329-363

<p>
<br>
Additional comment: This result implies that unlike in the world of commutative sets where
the Cantor set &Delta; continuously maps onto all metrizable compact spaces which yields that all separable C(K)s embed into C(&Delta;),
in the noncommutative world there is no universal separable C*-algebra.

 Marek Cuth (IM PAN/ WCNM): The predual of a von Neumann algebra is 1-Plichko
</strong>
<br><p>

<strong>Abstract:</strong> I will present a recent result of M. Bohata, J. Hamhalter and O. Kalenda
 that predual of a von Neumann algebra is 1-Plichko, i.e., it has a countably
 1-norming Markushevich basis (equivalently, there is a commutative 
projectional skeleton consisting of norm one projections). In particular, every dual of a C* algebra is 1-Plichko. 
I will concentrate on the techniques coming from the theory of von Neumann algebras and their applications contained in the proof.

 Piotr Koszmider (IM PAN): Traces of operators and the set theory of the Banach space C(N*)
</strong>
<br><p>

<strong>Abstract:</strong> A trace on a Banach algebra A is a linear bounded  functional 
&tau; on A such that &tau;(ab)=&tau;(ba) for all a, b in A. A charater  is a linear bounded  functional
&tau; on A such that &tau;(ab)=&tau;(a)&tau;(b) for all a, b in A. We will review known facts and open questions concerning
the existence of nonzero characters or nonzero traces on  the algebra B(X) of all  linear bounded operators
on a Banach space X. For example, generalizing P. Halmos' result concerning operators on the Hilbert space N. Laustsen
showed that if X is "infinitely divisible", then every operator on X is a sum of commutators and so
no nontrivial trace can exist on B(X). The continuum hypothesis implies that the Banach space C(N*)&equiv; l<sub>&infin;</sub>/c<sub>0</sub>
is "infinitely divisible" (Negrepontis), but we do not know if this is the case in ZFC. For example
in the Cohen model C(N*) is not isomorphic to any l<sub>&infin;</sub>-sum of Banach spaces (C. Brech, P. Koszmider).
So l<sub>&infin;</sub>/c<sub>0</sub> may provide a consistent negative answer to a question of A. Villena 
whether for every Banach space X isomorphic to its square, the algebra B(X) has no nontrivial traces.

 Marek Cuth (IM PAN): Do countable models of ZFC generate club of separable subspaces in a Banach space?
</strong>
<br><p>

<strong>Abstract:</strong> First, I will briefly talk about separable reductions and try to explain why 
it is interesting to solve the problem from the title. 
Then, I will talk about some partial results and about the difficulities when trying
 to solve the problem in full generality. Separable reduction is a method of extension
 the validity of a statement from separable spaces to the nonseparable setting not
 involving the proof of the statement in the separable case.
This method is based on a construction of a separable subspace with certain properties. 
One possibility of constructing a separable subspace of a Banach space X is
 to take countable model of ZFC (more precisely, of a finite fragment of ZFC), 
call it M, and then take the closure of the points from M which are in X. 
The question is, how good the family of so constructed separable subspaces can be. 
Namely, is it possible to find a family of countable models of ZFC in such a way that those subspaces will form a club?

<strong>Time and place:</strong> Thursdays  11.15-13.00 am,  room 105, Sniadeckich 8<p>
<p>
               <strong>The scope of the seminar: </strong>
Set-theoretic combinatorial and topological  methods in diverse fields of mathematics, with a special emphasis on abstract analysis like
  Banach spaces, Banach algebras, C*-algebras, Here we include both the developing of such methods as 
forcing, descriptive set theory, Ramsey theory as well as their concrete applications in the fields mentioned above.
<p>

<strong>Working group style: </strong> We will make efforts so that this seminar has
 more a working character rather than the presentation style. This means that we encourage long digressions,
 discussions, background preparations and participation of everyone. 
 We would like to immerse ourselves into the details of the mathematical arguments studied. 
Also the talks are usualy  devoted to research in progress or fascinating results leading to some project not yet resolved.
While ready final results could be presented at other seminars at IM PAN or UW.
