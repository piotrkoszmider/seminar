  <strong> Previous talks this semester: </strong><br>
<br>
<p>
<strong>21.01.2016, 11<sup>15</sup> room 105</strong> <br>
<strong>Speaker: Damian Sobota (IM PAN)</strong><br>
<strong>Title: The Nikodym property of von Neumann algebras</strong><br><p>
<strong>Abstract:</strong> "The Nikodym property of C*-algebras comes from the theory of
 Boolean algebras and is closely related to the classical Banach-Steinhaus theorem for Banach spaces 
(also called the Uniform Boundedness Principle). 
A Boolean algebra A has the Nikodym property if every elementwise bounded sequence of 
finitely additive measures on A is uniformly bounded. 
Classical examples of algebras with the Nikodym property contain &sigma;-complete algebras, 
algebras with Haydon's Subsequential Completeness Property and the 
algebra of Jordan-measurable subsets of the unit interval [0,1].

The Nikodym property for C*-algebras is defined similarly. 
A C*-algebra  A has the Nikodym property if every 
sequence of linear functionals on A which is bounded on each projection in A is 
bounded on each element of A (and consequently norm-bounded).
In the first part of the talk, we shall prove the Nikodym theorem stating 
that all &sigma;-complete Boolean algebras have the Nikodym property and provide several 
basic facts concerning the property for C*-algebras. 
After this, using the representation of commutative von Neumann algebras in terms of L<sub>&infin;</sub>(&mu;)-spaces
 and the Nikodym theorem, we shall obtain the similar result of Darst for von Neumann algebras.

The second part will be devoted to the proof of the above-mentioned representation theorem of commutative von Neumann algebras."

<strong>14.01.2016, 11<sup>15</sup> room 105</strong> <br>
<strong>Speaker: Maciej Malicki (SGH)</strong><br>
<strong>Title: Amenable groups</strong><br><p>
<strong>Abstract:</strong> "The talk will present an overview of some aspects of classical and contemporary studies of amenable groups.
I will start with basic definitions, and say a little bit about the Banach-Tarski paradox. 
Then, using a characterization of the notion of amenability that can be applied to all 
topological groups (the existence of invariant measures on flows), I will formulate 
certain variants of it, such as extreme amenability, and unique ergodicity. 
I will also briefly discuss recent research in this area, in connection with 
Fraissé limits, Ramsey theory, and Stone-Èech compactifications."
<br>
<p>
<strong>19.11.2015, 11<sup>15</sup> room 105</strong> <br>
<strong>Speaker: Tomasz Kochanek (IMPAN)</strong><br>
<strong>Title: A non-separable reflexive Banach space without the Elton-Odell property</strong><br><p>
<strong>Abstract:</strong> "We shall discuss a construction of a non-separable, reflexive Banach space X for which there is no
 e > 0 and an uncountable subset A of the unit ball of X so that ||x - y|| > 1 + e for all distinct x,y from A.
 In other words, X fails the "uncountable" version of the Elton-Odell property; 
recall that a non-reflexive example, namely c<sub>0</sub>(&omega;<sub>1</sub>), was given by Elton and Odell themselves.
 The space in question can be described as a "quasi-symmetric version of a long Tsirelon space with weights". 
A crucial role in the construction is played by certain Todorcevic's pseudo-metric on &omega;<sub>1</sub> which we shall also discuss.
 The construction moreover shows that the two theorems obtained jointly with T. Kania 
(discussed during this seminar on October 1) are, in a sense, sharp.

<strong>05.11.2015, 11<sup>15</sup> room 105</strong> <br>
<strong>Speaker: Eva Pernecka (IMPAN)</strong><br>
<strong>Title: Uniformly differentiable mappings from l<sub>&infin;</sub></strong><br><p>
<strong>Abstract:</strong> "We will discuss the rigidity of l<sub>&infin;</sub> and l<sub>&infin;</sub><sup>n</sup> with respect 
to uniformly differentiable mappings. Our main result is a non-linear analogy of the result on rigidity of l<sub>&infin;</sub> with 
respect to non-weakly compact linear operators by Rosenthal, and it generalises 
the theorem on non-complementability of c<sub>0</sub> in l<sub>&infin;</sub> due to Phillips."

<strong>29.10.2015, 11<sup>15</sup> room 105</strong> <br>
<strong>Speaker: Saeed Ghasemi (IMPAN)</strong><br>
<strong>Title: The rigidity of isomorphisms between some corona algebras - continuation</strong><br><p>
<br>
<p>
<strong>15.10.2015, 11<sup>15</sup> room 105</strong> <br>
<strong>Speaker: Saeed Ghasemi (IMPAN)</strong><br>
<strong>Title: The rigidity of isomorphisms between some corona algebras - continuation</strong><br><p>
<br>
<p>
<strong>08.10.2015, 11<sup>15</sup> room 105</strong> <br>
<strong>Speaker: Saeed Ghasemi (IMPAN)</strong><br>
<strong>Title: The rigidity of isomorphisms between some corona algebras</strong><br><p>
<strong>Abstract:</strong> "The rigidity question was first studied for the automorphisms of Boolean algebras. 
A groundbreaking result of Shelah shows that it is consistent with the usual axioms of mathematics (ZFC) that all
 automorphisms of the Boolean algebra P(N)/Fin are trivial, in the sense that they are implemented by almost permutations 
of the natural numbers N. While assuming the Continuum Hypothesis, a transfinite induction due to Rudin shows that 
there are many nontrivial automorphisms of P(N)/Fin. Using the Stone duality, the results of this kind can be 
translated in the category of (zero-dimensional locally compact and Hausdorff) topological spaces. 
Motivated by a question of Brown-Douglas-Fillmore, the rigidity question was studied in the non-commutative 
settings for the corona of C*-algebras. It is proved by Philips-Weaver that assuming the Continuum Hypothesis 
the Calkin algebra has outer automorphisms. On the other hand Farah showed that
the Open Coloring Axiom implies that all the automorphisms of the Calkin algebras are inner (implemented by almost unitary elements of B(H)). 
In my talks we will take a closer look at Farah's result and study the rigidity question for 
the isomophisms between the corona of Finite-Dimensional Decomposition algebras (reduced products of matrices) 
and its relevance to Farah's result. We will also look at the later question in more general setting,
 motivated by the more recent results of Farah-Shelah about the Boolean algebra counterparts."

<strong>01.10.2015, 11<sup>15</sup> room 105</strong> <br>
<strong>Speaker: Tomasz Kochanek (IMPAN/UW)</strong><br>
<strong>Title: Uncountable sets of unit vectors that are separated by more than 1 </strong><br><p>
<strong>Abstract:</strong> "Kottman proved that in the unit ball of any infinite-dimensional 
Banach space one can find an infinite subset such that the distance between any two distinct elements 
is larger than 1. Elton and Odell, employing Ramsey theory, strengthened this result by showing that 
it is possible to have all distances at least equal to 1+c for some c>0 depending only on the given space. 
Both these results are far-reaching generalizations of the Riesz lemma. We will investigate their 
non-separable versions focusing on two results: (1) the analogue of Kottman's theorem is valid for every non-separable reflexive Banach space 
(the set from the assertion is then uncountable); (2) the analogue of the Elton-Odell theorem 
is valid for every non-separable superreflexive Banach space."

<strong>24.09.2015, 11<sup>15</sup> room 105</strong> <br>
<strong>Speaker: Antonio Aviles (Universidad de Murcia)</strong><br>
<strong>Title: Compact subsets of the first Baire class. </strong><br><p>
<strong>Abstract:</strong> "Compact spaces consisting of Baire first class functions in the pointwise 
topology have been extensively studied with a number of remarkable results by Rosenthal, 
Bourgain, Fremlin, Talagrand, Todorcevic and others. They play a role in the category of
 compact spaces that is analogous to that of Borel
 sets in the class of all subsets of the real line. 
We shall discuss some history and some recent results about them in collaboration with Stevo Todorcevic."

<strong>Time and place:</strong> Thursdays  11.15-13.00 am,  room 105, Sniadeckich 8<p>
<p>
               <strong>The scope of the seminar: </strong>
Set-theoretic combinatorial and topological  methods in diverse fields of mathematics, with a special emphasis on abstract analysis like
  Banach spaces, Banach algebras, C*-algebras, Here we include both the developing of such methods as 
forcing, descriptive set theory, Ramsey theory as well as their concrete applications in the fields mentioned above.
<p>

<strong>Working group style: </strong> We will make efforts so that this seminar has
 more a working character rather than the presentation style. This means that we encourage long digressions,
 discussions, background preparations and participation of everyone. 
 We would like to immerse ourselves into the details of the mathematical arguments studied. 
Also the talks are usualy  devoted to research in progress or fascinating results leading to some project not yet resolved.
While ready final results could be presented at other seminars at IM PAN or UW.
