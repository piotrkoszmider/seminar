<strong>Title: Structural properties of Banach spaces in terms of certain classes od Baire-1 functions"
</strong>
<br>
<strong>Abstract:</strong>
"We will discuss some connections between structural properties of separable Banach spaces and certain classes of
 functions acting on the unit dual ball with the weak* topology. One of the most classical results in this spirit,
 due to Odell and Rosenthal, says that a separable Banach space X contains an isomorphic copy of l<sub>1</sub> if and only if
 the unit ball of X** contains a non-Baire-1 element. We will describe another class of functions which is responsible
 for containing a copy of c<sub>0</sub> (via Rosenthal's c<sub>0</sub>-theorem) and leads quite naturally to other more exotic 
classes which are responsible for producing spreading models equivalent to the canonical bases of l<sub>1</sub> or c<sub>0</sub>. 
The talk will be largely based on the paper by R. Haydon, E. Odell and H. Rosenthal,
 "On certain classes of Baire-1 functions with applications to Banach space theory", Lecture Notes in Math. 1470 (1991), 1-35."

<strong>Title: Classification of operator systems</strong>
<br>
<strong>Abstract:</strong>
I will discuss the problem of classification of separable operator systems up to complete order isomorphism. 
While the relation for arbitrary separable operator systems is a complete orbit equivalence relation, 
the restriction to the class of finite-dimensional ones gives a smooth equivalence relation. 
This is joint work with M. Argerami, S. Coskey, M. Kennedy, M. Kalantar and M. Lupini."

<strong>Title: Phillips's lemma, Schur's theorem and cardinal invariants of the continuum.</strong>
<br>
<strong>Abstract:</strong>
Phillips's lemma asserts that for every sequence of measures (&mu;<sub>n</sub>) on P(N) satisfying lim<sub>n</sub> &mu;<sub>n</sub>(A)=0 for 
every subset A of N, we have: lim<sub>n</sub> &Sigma;<sub>j</sub> |&mu;<sub>n</sub>({j})|=0.
The lemma has many consequences in vector measure theory and Banach space theory. 
E.g. Schur's theorem stating that every weakly convergent sequence in l<sub>1</sub> is norm convergent is an 
easy application of Phillips's lemma. During my talk I will show in ZFC that there exists a family F of subsets 
of N such that |F|=cof(N) (the cofinality of the Lebesgue measure zero ideal) and satisfying the following Phillips-like condition:
 for every sequence of measures (&mu;<sub>n</sub>) on P(N) satisfying lim<sub>n</sub> &mu;<sub>n</sub>(A)=0 for every A in F, we have:
 lim<sub>n</sub> &Sigma;<sub>j</sub> |&mu;<sub>n</sub>({j})|=0. 
On the other hand, I will also show that no family F of subsets of N such that |F|&lt;p (the pseudo-intersection number) can be used."

<strong>Title: Amenable groups.</strong>
<br>
<strong>Abstract:</strong>
I will continue an overview of some aspects of classical and contemporary studies of amenable groups.
 This time I will focus on properties of universal minimal flows of non-archimedean groups 
(i.e. automorphism groups of countable models), and the notion of extreme amenability.

Recall that a flow is a continuous action of a topological group on a compact space.
 A flow is called minimal if all its orbits are dense. For every topological group there 
exists a universal such flow, and, it turns out that there exist 
many "large" groups - called extremely amenable - for which it is trivial.

I will explain how to construct the universal minimal flow for a 
non-archimedean group of the form Aut(M) using Stone-Èech compactifications, 
and how to relate extreme amenability to certain properties of ultrafilters 
naturally associated with the model M. This connection is based on Ramsey theory."

<strong>Title: Weakly Radon-Nikodým compact spaces.</strong>
<br>
<strong>Abstract:</strong>
A compact space is said to be weakly Radon-Nikodým if it is 
homeomorphic to a weak*-compact subset of the dual of a Banach space not containing an isomorphic copy of  l<sub>1</sub>. 
In this talk I will show some topological properties of this class of compact spaces and 
its relation with other classes of compact spaces such as Radon-Nikodým or Corson compacta.
Most of the results of this talk are contained in the paper 'On weakly Radon-Nikodým spaces' which is available on arxiv.org.

<strong>Title: The Gelfand space of the measure algebra.</strong>
<br>
<strong>Abstract:</strong>
In this talk I would like to present some recent results concerning the
Banach algebra M(T) of Borel regular measures on the circle group with the
convolution product. Since it is well-known that the spectrum of a measure
can be much bigger then the closure of the values of its Fourier-Stieltjes
transform (the Wiener-Pitt phenomenon) it is natural to ask what kind of
topological properties of the Gelfand space Ge(M(T)) are responsible for this
unusual spectral behaviour. It follows immediately from the existence of
the Wiener-Pitt phenomenon that the set Z identified with Fourier-Stieltjes
coefficients is not dense in Ge(M(T)). However, it is not clear if any other
countable dense subset of this space exists. During my talk, I will disprove
this fact - i.e. I will show the non-separability of the Gelfand space of the
measure algebra on the circle group. This result is contained in a paper 'On
topological properties of the measure algebra on the circle group' written in
a collaboration with Micha&#322; Wojciechowski which has not been published yet
but is available on arxiv.org with identifier: 1603.05864.

<strong>Title: The Szlenk power type of injective tensor products of Banach spaces.</strong>
<br>
<strong>Abstract:</strong>
We shall discuss the notion of the Szlenk power type (strictly related to the Szlenk index) and its 
relationships with asymptotic geometry of Banach spaces. In particular, 
we will describe how the so-called tree maps and subsequential tree estimates
 can be used as tools to understand the dynamics of the Szlenk derivations. Next, 
we will prove a formula for the Szlenk power type of the injective tensor product of
 Banach spaces with the Szlenk index at most &omega; (a joint result with S. Draga).
 This allows us, for example, to determine the moduli of asymptotic smoothness
 of the spaces of compact operators between l<sub>p</sub>-spaces.

<strong>Title: Riemann integrability versus weak continuity.</strong>
<br>
<strong>Abstract:</strong>
We introduce some properties of Banach spaces related with Riemann integrability
 and we study the relation between weak-continuity and Riemann integrability. 
In particular, a Banach space is said to have the weak Lebesgue property if every Riemann integrable 
function from the unit interval into it is weakly continuous almost everywhere. 
We present several results concerning the weak Lebesgue property.

<strong>Title: Nonseparable growth of N supporting a strictly positive
measure.</strong>
<br>
<strong>Abstract:</strong>
We will construct in ZFC a compactification &gamma;N of N such
that its remainder &gamma;N\N is not separable and carries a strictly
positive measure, i.e. measure positive on all nonempty open subsets.
Moreover, the measure on our space is defined by the asymptotic density of
subsets of N. Our remainder is the Stone space of some Boolean subalgebra of
the algebra Bor(2<sup>N</sup>) of all Borel subsets of 2<sup>N</sup> containing all clopen sets.
This line of research is motivated  by the problem
of characterizing the Banach spaces c<sub>0</sub>&sube; X&sube; l<sub>&infin;</sub> such that the space c<sub>0</sub> is complemented in X.

<strong>Time and place:</strong> Thursdays  11.15-13.00 am,  room 105, Sniadeckich 8<p>
<p>
               <strong>The scope of the seminar: </strong>
Set-theoretic combinatorial and topological  methods in diverse fields of mathematics, with a special emphasis on abstract analysis like
  Banach spaces, Banach algebras, C*-algebras, Here we include both the developing of such methods as 
forcing, descriptive set theory, Ramsey theory as well as their concrete applications in the fields mentioned above.
<p>

<strong>Working group style: </strong> We will make efforts so that this seminar has
 more a working character rather than the presentation style. This means that we encourage long digressions,
 discussions, background preparations and participation of everyone. 
 We would like to immerse ourselves into the details of the mathematical arguments studied. 
Also the talks are usualy  devoted to research in progress or fascinating results leading to some project not yet resolved.
While ready final results could be presented at other seminars at IM PAN or UW.
