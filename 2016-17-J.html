<strong>Title: "Minimal dynamics, C*-algebras, and classification." 
</strong>
<br>
<p>
<strong>Abstract:</strong>

"A minimal dynamical system consists of a compact metrizable space and 
a homeomorphism such that the orbit of every point is dense. 
To such a system, one may associate a C*-algebra which aims to capture the
 orbit equivalence class of the system. In dimension zero, that is, 
minimal Cantor systems, one may use C*-algebraic invariants 
to distinguish minimal dynamical systems up to orbit equivalence. 
These invariants come from the more general programme of classification
 for simple separable unital nuclear C*-algebras. In higher dimensions, however, 
the C*-algebras associated to minimal dynamical systems become more difficult to handle. 
I will discuss the history of their eventual classification (as C*-algebras) 
as well as why it becomes difficult to extract dynamical information from this classification."

<strong>Title: "A non-commutative Mr&oacute;wka C*-algebra" 
</strong>
<br>
<p>
<strong>Abstract:</strong>

"For an almost disjoint family of subsets of natural numbers,
one can define the associated &Psi;-space, which is a locally compact,
separable and scattered space of the Cantor-Bendixson height 2. In
1977 Mrowka constructed a maximal almost disjoint family of size
continuum for which the associated &Psi;-space has the property that
it's Cech-Stone compactification and one-point compactification
coincide. By the Gelfand-Naimark duality this translates to a
commutative C*-algebra A which contains c<sub>0</sub> as an essential ideal such that A/c<sub>0</sub> is isomorphic to
c<sub>0</sub>(2<sup>&omega;</sup>)  and has the property that its multiplier algebra is *-isomorphic to its
(minimal) unitization. In a joint work with Piotr Koszmider we
constructed a non-commutative analog of this example. Namely a
C*-algebra A which contains the algebra  K(l<sub>2</sub>) of compact operators  on the
separable Hilbert space l<sub>2</sub> as an essential ideal such that A/K(l<sub>2</sub>) is *-isomorphic
to K(l<sub>2</sub>(2<sup>&omega;</sup>)) and has the property
that the multiplier algebra of A is *-isomorphic to the unitization of
A. In particular this algebra can not be isomorphic to the tensor
product of itself with the algebra of compact operators on l<sub>2</sub>, i.e.,
it is not stable. The C*-algebra A is a non-separable scattered
C*-algebra of the Cantor-Bendixson height 2, and in particular it is
approximately finite and type I.
In my talks I will present the ideas behind the commutative
construction of Mrowka &Psi;-space and show  how they can be
generalized to the non-commutative setting using "systems of
almost matrix units" instead of almost disjoint families. Moreover I will
talk about the relation between our example with the context of
extensions of stable C*-algebras"

<strong>Title: "Set theory and automorphisms of C*-algebras" 
</strong>
<br>
<p>
<strong>Abstract:</strong>

"The influence of set theory on the homeomorphisms group of Stone-Cech remainders of locally compact
 spaces has been noted since the work of Rudin and of Shelah on the automorphisms group of P(&omega;)/Fin.
 Motivated by the search of K-theoretical reversing automorphisms of the Calkin algebra, Phillips and Weaver,
 and then Farah, showed that the assumption of the Continuum Hypothesis on one hand, and of forcing axioms 
on the other, has influence on the automorphisms structure of certain corona C*-algebras.
It is conjectured that under the assumption of CH, whenever A is a separable nonunital C*-algebra, 
its corona has a large (and wild) group of automorphisms, while forcing axioms (such as PFA), provide a strong rigidity for these groups.  

In this talk, after a brief introduction of the main concepts involved and recalling  past results,
 we present two recent results. We show that under CH the automorphisms group of C(&beta;X-X)
 (which is the corona of C<sub>0</sub>(X)) has size larger than continuum, whenever X is a noncompact  manifold.
 Working on the other side of the conjecture we sketch the argument that shows that if A is a nuclear 
separable C*-algebra with plenty of projections then PFA implies that the corona of A has only trivial (i.e., Borel)
 automorphisms. The latter result is joint work with McKenney.

<strong>Title: "The Akemann-Weaver counterexample to Naimark's Problem" 
</strong>
<br>
<p>
<strong>Abstract:</strong>

"In 1948, Naimark observed that the compact operators K(H) on a Hilbert space H 
have a unique non-zero irreducible representation, up to unitary equivalence.
  He then asked if this in fact characterises K(H) among C*-algebras, which 
became the long-standing open question known as Naimark's problem.  
In 2004, Akemann and Weaver constructed a (necessarily non-separable) 
counterexample using the diamond principle (a well-known combinatorial principle independent of ZFC), 
which we outline in this talk.

<strong>Title: "Ulam's stability problem for disjointness preserving operators on C*-algebras" 
</strong>
<br>
<p>
<strong>Abstract:</strong>

"Ulam's general stability problem asks whether given some mathematical object
 satisfying a certain property approximately, there must exist an object close to
 the given one and satisfying the given property exactly. 
<br>
<p>
Ulam himself posed this question in 1940 in the context of almost
 homomorphisms between metric groups (solved positively by Hyers) 
and since then this stability problem has been widely investigated for various 
classes of maps and proved to be of crucial importance in many parts of functional analysis. 
Just to name a few: the so-called quasi-linear maps play an important role in the theory of 
twisted sums of Banach spaces; approximate homomorphisms on Banach algebras are crucial 
in the formulation of B.E. Johnson's theory of derivations and cohomologies of Banach algebras.
<p>

We shall deal with disjointness preserving maps between C*-algebras which 
are building blocks in the Winter-Zacharias theory of nuclear dimension 
(and are rather called order zero maps in this context). 
<p>
A bounded linear operator T: A &rarr; B acting between C*-algebras A and B is 
called &epsilon;-disjointness preserving, 
provided that T(x*) = T(x)* for every x in A and ||T(x)T(y)|| &le; &epsilon;||x||||y|| 
for all self-adjoint x,y in A with xy = 0. 
<p>
The aim of the talk is to prove a stability theorem for almost 
disjointness preserving operators defined on a nuclear C*-algebra 
and taking values in a C*-algebra which is isomorphic to a dual
 Banach bimodule over itself (or, more generally, is a closed two-sided ideal in such an algebra).
 The key step of the proof is to reduce this problem to a corresponding stability question concerning 
Jordan homomorphisms. 
<p>
The first part of the talk should have a preparatory character. 
We will recall some basic facts about nuclear dimension, in particular, 
how almost order zero approximations arise in this context. 
We will also need a little bit of the theory of cohomology of Jordan triples which
 is required to understand the approximation procedure applied to almost Jordan homomorphisms. 
The second part will be devoted to the proof of the announced stability result."

<strong>Title: "An introduction to scattered C*-algebras"  - Continuation
</strong>
<br>
<strong>Abstract:</strong>

"The techniques and constructions of compact, Hausdorff
scattered spaces, or equivalently (by the Stone duality) superatomic
Boolean algebras, have been used in the literature of Banach spaces
for many fundamental results in the forms of Banach spaces C(K), or
more generally Asplund spaces. Scattered C*-algebras were introduced
as C*-algerbas which are Asplund as Banach spaces. However, the
analogues of the commutative tools and constructions were not
developed for these C*-algebras. In a joint work with Piotr Koszmider (<a href="https://www.impan.pl/~koszmider/scattered.pdf" class=link>S. Ghasemi, P. 
Koszmider; Noncommutative Cantor-Bendixson
derivatives and scattered C*-algebras</a>)
we investigated these tools and constructions parallel to the ones in
set-theoretic topology. I will introduce the Cantor-Bendixson
derivatives for C*-algebras, obtained by using the ideal generated by
the minimal projections of these algebras, and present some of the
basic properties of these ideals. I will also show how these notions
can be used to construct exotic C*-algebras. In particular, I will
show the existence of a non-separable AF-algebra which is an inductive
limit of stable AF-ideals, yet it has no maximal stable ideal."

</strong>
<br>

"This talk is based on a paper <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.02429.pdf" class=link>T. Bice, P. Koszmider, A note on the Akemann-Doner and Farah-Wofsey constructions,
To appear in PAMS</a> where we removed an additional assumption of the continuum hypothesis from a previous
construction of Akemann and Doner  of an algebra like in the title (A nonseparable C*-algebra with only separable abelian C*-subalgebras.
Bull. London Math. Soc. 11 (1979), no. 3, 279–284). The main combinatorial "trick" is to use Luzin's almost disjoint family,
so first, we will describe this notion."

<strong>Title: "Locally Compact Stone Duality"
</strong>
<br>
<strong>Abstract:</strong>
"Almost all well-studied real rank zero C*-algebras can be constructed from inverse semigroups.  
We focus on just the first part of this construction, where a zero dimensional compact (Hausdorff) 
topological space comes from Exel's tight spectrum of the idempotent semilattice.  
First we show how this can be generalized to a kind of Stone duality between separative posets 
and 'pseudobases' of zero dimensional locally compact spaces.  
This is closely related to a well-known set theoretic construction of a Boolean algebra from a poset.  
Next, we consider bases of general locally compact spaces, how these can be axiomatized and how the space can be reconstructed as a generalized Stone space. 
 Time permitting, we will outline how this should allow more general (e.g. projectionless)
 C*-algebras to be constructed from inverse semigroups."

<strong><h2>SPECIAL NONCOMMUTATIVE SEMESTER</h2> </strong>
<p>
During the fall semester 2016/17 the seminar is devoted to applictaions 
of set theory in noncommutative mathematics. This is a part of satellite events to
Simons semester: <a href="http://bcc.impan.pl/16Simons-III/" class=link>Noncommutative geometry the next generation</a>
which  takes place at IM PAN during this semester. 

<p>


<strong>Time and place:</strong> Thursdays  10.15-12.00 am,  room 105, Sniadeckich 8<p>
<p>
Due to lecture courses at Simon's semester temporary time and place of the seminar is
<strong>Tuesdays 15.15-17.00, room 106</strong>, Sniadeckich 8<p>
<p>

               <strong>The scope of the seminar: </strong>
Set-theoretic combinatorial and topological  methods in diverse fields of mathematics, with a special emphasis on abstract analysis like
  Banach spaces, Banach algebras, C*-algebras, Here we include both the developing of such methods as 
forcing, descriptive set theory, Ramsey theory as well as their concrete applications in the fields mentioned above.
<p>

<strong>Working group style: </strong> We will make efforts so that this seminar has
 more a working character rather than the presentation style. This means that we encourage long digressions,
 discussions, background preparations and participation of everyone. 
 We would like to immerse ourselves into the details of the mathematical arguments studied. 
Also the talks are usualy  devoted to research in progress or fascinating results leading to some project not yet resolved.
While ready final results could be presented at other seminars at IM PAN or UW.
