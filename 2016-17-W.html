<strong>"A non separable uniformly convex Banach space on which there are few
 operators" </strong> 

<br>
<p>

<strong>Abstract:</strong> 
"It will be shown using Shelah’s extension of an “anti-Ramsey” theorem of Todorcevic 
that there exists a uniformly convex Banach space of density character
 &omega;<sub>1</sub>  on which every bounded linear operator is the sum of a scalar multiple
of the identity and an operator of separable range".

 <strong>Thursday, 25.05. 2017, 10<sup>15</sup>, room 105,   Maciej Malicki (Warsaw School of Economics)</strong>
<strong>"Generic representations of countable groups"</strong> 

<br>
<p>
<strong>Abstract:</strong> 
Suppose that X is a mathematical object, and let Aut(X) denote the group of all automorphisms of X. 
A representation of a group G on X is a homomorphism of G into Aut(X), 
and the space of all such representations is denoted by Rep(G,X). 
Typically, X is a Hilbert space H (then Aut(X) is the unitary group U(H)) 
but one can consider other situations as well, e.g. 
X being the Urysohn space U or a countable structure such as the natural numbers with equality 
(then Aut(X) is the symmetric group of all permutations of natural numbers) or the random graph.
<br> <p>
If G is countable and discrete, and Aut(X) is endowed with the topological structure of a Polish group,
 Rep(G,X) can be endowed with a Polish topology as well. 
Then, for a given G and X, it is natural to ask whether there exists a generic representation, 
that is, whether there exists a comeager orbit under the conjugation action of Aut(X) on Rep(G,X). 
After an introduction to this topic, I will discuss the case of X equal to U or H. 
For U, there never exists a generic representation, and similarly for H, 
if G is a group with the Haagerup property and with densely many finite dimensional representations in the unitary dual.
 The general situation for H is not clear but I will present some results that may either 
lead to examples of groups with a generic unitary representation 
or a proof that groups with the Kazhdan property, 
and with densely many finite dimensional representations in the unitary dual, do not exist. 
The latter would answer a question of Lubotzky and Shalom.

This is joint work in progress with Michal Doucha.

<strong>Thursday, 18.05. 2017, 10<sup>15</sup>, room 105,   Piotr Koszmider (IMPAN)</strong>
<strong>"Massive quotients of algebras in various models"</strong> 

<br>
<p>
<strong>Abstract:</strong> 
We will discuss some questions, results and proofs concerning
the dependence of properties of massive quotients of algebras (P(N)/Fin, l<sub>&infin;</sub>/c<sub>0</sub>, B(l<sub>2</sub>)/K(l<sub>2</sub>))
on additional set-theoretic assumptions.  In particular we are interested in the question
what is the corona algebra M(A&cap;A*)/A&cap;A* where A is a maximal left-ideal of the Calkin algebra or 
any SAW* C*-algebra if A&cap;A* is nonunital (cf. it is one dimensional if A is II<sub>1</sub>-factor (Sakai)
or if A is C(K) for K extremally disconnected with no isolated points).
<br>
We will spend the main part of the talk on  the proofs of the corresponding commutative results showing
that the Cech-Stone reminder of  N*-{x} may have just one point (Gillman) or may be a nonmetrizable compact space (Malykhin),
depending on  consistent set-theoretic assumptions, where N* is the Gelfand space of the Banach algebra
l<sub>&infin;</sub>/c<sub>0</sub> or the Stone space of the Boolean algebra P(N)/Fin, i.e., N*=&beta;N-N. To follow the talk no foundational knowledge is necessary
as we will use combinatorial characterizations of P(N)/Fin in various models due to
Parovichenko (CH) and Dow-Hart (Cohen model).

<strong>"Twisted sums of c<sub>0</sub> and C(K) spaces"</strong> 

<br>
<p>
<strong>Abstract:</strong> 
"A twisted sum of Banach spaces Z and Y is a short exact sequence

<center>0&rarr;Z&rarr;X&rarr;Y&rarr;0,</center>
where X is a Banach space and the maps are bounded linear operators.
Such a twisted sum is called trivial if the exact sequence splits, i.e.
if the map Z &rarr; X admits a left inverse (in other words, if the map
X &rarr; Y admits a right inverse).
This is equivalent to saying that  the range of the map Z &rarr; X is
complemented in X.
<p>
We investigate the following problem posed by Cabello Sanchez,
Castillo, Kalton, and Yost:
<p>
Let K be a nonmetrizable compact space. Does there exist a nontrivial
twisted sum of c<sub>0</sub> and C(K)?
<p>
Using additional set-theoretic assumptions we give the first examples of
compact spaces K providing  a negative answer to this question.
We show that under Martin's axiom and the negation of the continuum
hypothesis, if either K is the Cantor cube 2<sup>&omega;<sub>1</sub></sup> or K is a
separable scattered compact space of height 3 and weight &omega;<sub>1</sub>,
then every twisted sum of c<sub>0</sub> and C(K) is trivial.
<p>
This is a joint research with Grzegorz Plebanek."

<strong>"SAW* and corona algebras"</strong> 

<br>
<p>


<strong>Abstract:</strong> 
"SAW*-algebras were introduced by G. K. Pedersen as noncommutative 
analogous of sub-Stonean spaces (F-spaces) i.e., spaces for which two disjoint open, 
&sigma;-compact sets have disjoint closures.
 Many properties of sub-Stonean spaces were generalized to general SAW*-algebras. 
For example Pedersen showed that the corona algebras of sigma-unital C*-algebras are SAW*, 
which generalizes the fact that Cech-Stone remainders of locally
 compact &sigma;-compact Hausdorff spaces are sub-Stonean spaces. 
I will show that SAW*-algebras can not be isomorphic to C*-tensor products of two infinite-dimensional C*-algebras. 
This in particular answers a question of Simon Wassermann who conjectured that the same is true for the Calkin algebra. 
It also generalizes the fact that the product of two sub-Stonean
spaces is not sub-Stonean."

<strong>"Domains and Distances"</strong> 

<br>
<p>
<strong>Abstract:</strong> 
"We aim to give a gentle introduction to the theory of domains - directed complete continuous posets.  
The emphasis will be on definitions and examples. 
 We then discuss generalisations where order relations 
are replaced by non-symmetric distances, with examples from C*-algebras."

<strong>"On ultrafilters related to Rosenthal's lemma"</strong> 
<p>
 <strong>Note unusual time!</strong>
<br>
<p>
<strong>Abstract:</strong> 
"An infinite matrix (m<sub>k, n</sub>) with real entries
 is called Rosenthal if m<sub>k, n</sub> &ge; 0
for every k, n &isin; N and &sum;<sub>n&isin; N</sub>m<sub>k, n</sub> &le; 1 for every k &isin; N.
A non-empty family <i>F</i> of infinite subsets of natural numbers is
called Rosenthal if for every Rosenthal matrix and &epsilon;>0 there exists A in <i>F</i>
such that for every k in  A the following inequality holds: &sum;<sub>n&isin;
A, n&ne;k</sub>m<sub>k, n</sub><&epsilon;. Well-known and useful Rosenthal's lemma
states that the family  of all infnite subsets of natural numbers is Rosenthal. In my PhD thesis I proved
that every selective ultrafilter is Rosenthal (assuming such
ultrafilters exist). During the talk I will show a construction of an
ultrafilter which is simultaneously: 1) a Rosenthal family and 2) a
P-point but 3) not a Q-point (hence it is not selective). I will also
make some comments suggesting that probably every ultrafilter is a
Rosenthal family."

<strong>"Weak sequential completeness of Lipschitz-free spaces (part two)"</strong> (joint work with T. Kochanek)
 
<br>
<p>
<strong>Abstract:</strong> 
"Adapting the proof of a classical Bourgain's result, we have extended an earlier work due to Cúth, Doucha and Wojtaszczyk, 
and we have proved that for every compact subset M of a superreflexive Banach 
space the Lipschitz-free (Arens-Eels) space &#198;(M) is weakly sequentially complete. 
So, in particular, it does not contain a copy of c<sub>0</sub>. 
In the second part of the talk, we shall present the proof of the announced result."

<strong>"Weak sequential completeness of Lipschitz-free spaces (part one)"</strong> (joint work with E. Pernecká)
 
<br>
<p>
<strong>Abstract:</strong> Adapting the proof of a classical Bourgain's result, 
we have extended an earlier work due to Cúth, Doucha and Wojtaszczyk, 
and we have proved that for every compact subset M of a superreflexive
 Banach space the Lipschitz-free (Arens-Eels) space &#198;(M) is weakly sequentially complete.
 So, in particular, it does not contain a copy of c<sub>0</sub>. In the first part of the talk, 
we shall explain the role of the superreflexivity assumption and connections 
between our result and a still open question of Dutrieux and Ferenczi
 about structural properties of Arens-Eels spaces. 
We will prove a certain combinatorial lemma about geometry of superreflexive
 spaces which strengthens one of classical James' characterizations. 
We will also provide several nontrivial examples of metric spaces M to which our result applies, 
and which extend the list of hitherto known examples
 of M with &#198;(M) being weakly sequentially complete like, e.g., 
uniformly discrete spaces, snowflakings and finite-dimensional cubes.
 Finally, we will present some ideas for continuation of this research.

<strong>Time and place:</strong> Thursdays  10.15-12.00 am,  room 105, Sniadeckich 8<p>
<br>
<p>

               <strong>The scope of the seminar: </strong>
Set-theoretic combinatorial and topological  methods in diverse fields of mathematics, with a special emphasis on abstract analysis like
  Banach spaces, Banach algebras, C*-algebras, Here we include both the developing of such methods as 
forcing, descriptive set theory, Ramsey theory as well as their concrete applications in the fields mentioned above.
<p>

<strong>Working group style: </strong> We will make efforts so that this seminar has
 more a working character rather than the presentation style. This means that we encourage long digressions,
 discussions, background preparations and participation of everyone. 
 We would like to immerse ourselves into the details of the mathematical arguments studied. 
Also the talks are usualy  devoted to research in progress or fascinating results leading to some project not yet resolved.
While ready final results could be presented at other seminars at IM PAN or UW.
