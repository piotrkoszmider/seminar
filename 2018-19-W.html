<strong> Title: Stability of the Fredholm index</strong>
<p>

<strong>Abstract: </strong> "We will present the proof of a classical result which says that the index of a  Fredholm operator between Banach spaces   does not change if we perturbate  the operator by a strictly singular operator. No previous knowledge of the above notions is needed to follow the talk"

<strong> Title: A notion of support in Lipschitz-free spaces</strong>
<p>

<strong>Abstract: </strong> "We will show that the class of free spaces over closed subspaces of a complete metric space is closed under arbitrary intersections and that this leads to a natural definition of <i>support</i> applicable to all elements of free spaces. Although this property does not seem surprising, the proof is rather nontrivial. It follows from the particular algebraic structure of the spaces of Lipschitz functions (the isometric dual of the free space) described by Weaver.  We will discuss some characterizations and properties of supports. We will present their application to the study of extreme points of free spaces. And finally, we will have a look at the elements of free spaces induced by Radon measures. This is a joint work with Ram&oacute;n J. Aliaga."

<strong> Title: Universal AF-algebras</strong>
<p>

<strong>Abstract: </strong> "We study the approximately finite-dimensional (AF) C*-algebras that appear as inductive limits of sequences of finite-dimensional C*-algebras and left-invertible embeddings. We show that there is such a separable AF-algebra that satisfies similar homogeneity and universality properties as the Cantor set.  Joint work with Wiesław Kubiś, see: arxiv.org/pdf/1903.10392.pdf"

<strong> Title: Lifting  uncountable combinatorics to the Banach space level: 
Banach spaces C(K) with few operators. Part 1-4.</strong>
<p>

<strong>Abstract: </strong> "This series of 4 talks will be a minicourse on Banach spaces of continuous functions which have few operators, projections, injections etc. In particular they can be indecomposable and nonisomorphic with their hyperplanes. 
 To obtain this linear operator level rigidity one needs to construct  compact Ks which are  not only rigid in the usual sense, i.e.,  in terms of continuous mappings on K. One needs to deal with weak* continuous functions from K into the space M(K)
of Radon measures on K, so the combinatorics of the constructions needs stronger conditions then for 
endo-rigid Boolean algebras or strongly rigid compact spaces. We will present main arguments leading to C(K)s  with the required properties but the proofs of many lemmas will be omitted. The talks should be accessible to everyone with general analytic and topological  background."

<strong>  Arturo Mart&iacute;nez-Celis   (IMPAN),  </strong>
<p>
<strong> Title: Choice vs Determinacy</strong>
<p>

<strong>Abstract: </strong> "We will discuss the concept of infinite game and winning strategies and we will present some examples, theorems and applications to topology. In particular we will prove that every uncountable Borel set has a homeomorphic copy of the Cantor set. 

The axiom of determinacy (AD) states that for certain kind of games, the Gale-Stewart games, one player has always a winning strategy. The aim of this talk is to present the differences between the universes satisfying AD and the universes satisfying the axiom of choice."

<strong> Title: Compact extensions of first order logic, continuation from 16.04</strong>
<p>
<br>
<strong>Abstract: </strong> We aim to provide an exhaustive proof of the results of Keisler and Magidor and Malitz about the compactness of certain extensions of first order logic. Keisler's Theorem refers to the extension L(Q) where Q is the quantifier "There is an uncountable subset with a one dimensional property", similarly we can define Q<sub>n</sub> to be "There is an uncountable subset with an n-dimensional property". We will show that L(Q) is compact (Keisler's Theorem) and, assuming diamond, so 
is L(Q<sub>n</sub>:n&in; N) (Magidor and Malitz). We will also discuss why this framework can 
sometimes be useful for constructions of set theoretical structures.

<strong>Time and place:</strong> Thursdays  10.15-12.00 am,  room 105, Sniadeckich 8<p>
<br>
<p>

               <strong>The scope of the seminar: </strong>
Set-theoretic combinatorial and topological  methods in diverse fields of mathematics, with a special emphasis on abstract analysis like
  Banach spaces, Banach algebras, C*-algebras, Here we include both the developing of such methods as 
forcing, descriptive set theory, Ramsey theory as well as their concrete applications in the fields mentioned above.
<p>

<strong>Working group style: </strong> We will make efforts so that this seminar has
 more a working character rather than the presentation style. This means that we encourage long digressions,
 discussions, background preparations and participation of everyone. 
 We would like to immerse ourselves into the details of the mathematical arguments studied. 
Also the talks are usualy  devoted to research in progress or fascinating results leading to some project not yet resolved.
While ready final results could be presented at other seminars at IM PAN or UW.
