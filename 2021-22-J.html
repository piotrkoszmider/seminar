<strong> The diamond principle and its applications</strong>  
<p>
<strong> Abstract:</strong> "We will show the standard proof of the consistency of the diamond principle by forcing and how this principle is motivated by forcing considerations. We will also present some standard applications of the diamond principle"

<strong> Magic Sets </strong>  
<p>
<strong> Abstract:</strong> "Given a family of real functions F we say that a set M &sube; &Ropf; is magic for F if
for all f, g &isin; F we have f [M ] &sube; g[M ] &#8658; f = g. This notion was introduced by
Diamond, Pomerance and Rubel in 1981 [1]. Recently some results about magic
sets were proved by Halbeisen, Lischka and Schumacher [2]. Inspired by their work
I constructed two families of magic sets one of them being almost disjoint and the
other one being independent. During my talk I will sketch the background and
present the proof for the independent family, which uses a Kurepa tree."

<strong> Overcomplete sets in selected nonseparable Banach spaces </strong>  
<p>
<strong> Abstract:</strong> "A subset Y of a Banach space X is called overcomplete if
|Y|=dens(X) and for any set Z&sube;Y, such that |Z|=|Y|, Z is
linearly dense in X. A classical result says that every separable
Banach space admits an overcomplete set. The main goal of the talk is to
show how, using a certain Aronszajn tree, one can step-up this property
for selected nonseparable Banach spaces. If there is enough time, one
consistency result will also be stated and proved."

<strong> Bidiscrete system in compact spaces </strong>  
<p>
<strong> Abstract:</strong> "A set X of the square of a compact Hausdorff space K is called bidiscrete if for every (x, y) in X there is
a continuous real valued function f on K such that f(x)=1, f(y)=0 and f(x')=f(y') for any (x', y') in X-{(x, y)}. Bidiscrete sets play role in investigations related to biorthogonal systems in Banach spaces and irredundant sets in many algebraic structures induced by the compact K, but the question if there is in ZFC  a nonmetrizable compact K with no uncountable bidiscrete set remains open. There are such examples under special set-theoretic assumptions (Kunen) and there are no such totally disconnected examples under other assumptions (Todorcevic). We will discuss these and other know results and open problems."

<p>
<strong> A Banach space admitting few operators </strong>  
<p>
<strong> Abstract:</strong> "Using the colouring discussed in our previous talk we will construct a Banach space admitting few operators in the following sense: it will be a non-separable Banach space X such that every operator on X is of the form sI + S, where s is a scalar, S is an operator with a separable range and I stands for the identity on X, i.e. every operator on X is a homothety modulo the ideal of operators with separable range. The construction is due to Shelah and Steprans."

<strong> An antiramsey coloring of pairs </strong>  
<p>
<strong> Abstract:</strong> "We present a fundamental theorem by Todorcevic, stating that there exists a coloring of the complete graph of the first uncountable cardinality in uncountably many colors without an uncountable monochromatic clique. We also discuss other results of Todorcevic of similar nature, which are in some sense multidimensional variants of that coloring."

<strong> An application of Schreier's family</strong> 
<p>
<strong> Abstract:</strong> 
We will present the original solution due to  J. Schreier of a problem of S. Banach  which uses a subset of
the Boolean algebra  of clopen subsets of [0, &omega;<sup>&omega;</sup>] induced by 
a family of finite subsets of &Nopf;  known as Schreier's family.

<p>
<strong> The poset of projections in the Calkin algebra, continuation</strong> 
<p>
<strong> Abstract:</strong> We will discuss the set-theoretic properties of the poset of projections in the Calkin algebra of a separable Hilbert space, taking into account possible types of maximal well-ordered sequences and maximal antichains. We will show that it is consistent that among the mentioned subsets there are some with cardinality less than continuum and that Martin's axiom implies that all of them have cardinality continuum. We will also discuss relations between the poset of projections and the Boolean algebra P(&omega;)/Fin.  
Based on: Wofsey, Eric; P(&omega;)/fin and projections in the Calkin algebra. Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. 136 (2008), no. 2, 719-726.

<strong>Time and place:</strong> Tuesdays  13.30-15.00 pm,  room 403, &Sacute;niadeckich 8<p>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<p>


               <strong>The scope of the seminar: </strong>
Set-theoretic combinatorial and topological  methods in diverse fields of mathematics, 
with a special emphasis on abstract analysis like
  Banach spaces, Banach algebras, C*-algebras, Here we include both the developing of such methods as 
forcing, descriptive set theory, Ramsey theory as well as their concrete applications in the fields mentioned above.
<p>

<strong>Working group style: </strong> We will make efforts so that this seminar has
 more a working character rather than the presentation style. This means that we encourage long digressions,
 discussions, background preparations and participation of everyone. 
 We would like to immerse ourselves into the details of the mathematical arguments studied. 
Also the talks are usualy  devoted to research in progress or fascinating results leading to some project not yet resolved.
While ready final results could be presented at other seminars at IM PAN or UW.
