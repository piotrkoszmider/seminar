<p>
<strong> Elementary submodels and Corson-compact spaces.</strong>  
<p>

<strong>  Kacper Kucharski (MIM UW)</strong>
<p>
<strong> Using elementary submodels in topology (continuation).</strong>  
<p>
<strong> Abstract:</strong> "The talk will be focused on presenting so-called reflection results e.g., Dow's theorem: every nonmetrizable compact Hausdorff space contains a nonmetrizable subspace of cardinality &omega;<sub>1</sub>."

<strong>  Damian Sobota (KGRC Vienna)</strong>
<p>
<strong> Measures with the Additive Property and the random forcing</strong>  
<p>
<strong> Abstract:</strong> "Let &mu; be a finitely additive probability measure on &omega; which vanishes on points, that is, &mu;({n})=0 for every n&isin;&omega;. It follows immediately that &mu; is not &sigma;-additive, however it may be almost &sigma;-additive in the following weak sense. We say that &mu; has the Additive Property, (AP) in short, if for every sequence (A<sub>n</sub>) of pairwise disjoint subsets of &omega; there is a subset A such that A<sub>n</sub>\A is finite for every n&isin;&omega; and &mu;(A)=&Sigma;<sub>n</sub> &mu;(A<sub>n</sub>). Equivalently, for every decreasing sequence (A<sub>n</sub>) of subsets of &omega; there is a subset A such that A\A<sub>n</sub> is finite for every n&isin;&omega; and &mu;(A)=lim<sub>n</sub> &mu;(A<sub>n</sub>). The latter definition implies immediately that, e.g., an ultrafilter U on &omega; is a P-point if and only if the one-point measure &delta;<sub>U</sub> has (AP). And similarly as in the case of P-points the existence of measures with (AP) is independent of ZFC.
<br>
<p>
During my talk I will discuss basic properties of (families of) measures with (AP) as well as show, at least briefly, that using old ideas of Solovay and Kunen one can obtain a non-atomic measure with (AP) in the random model. The latter result implies that in this model there exists a ccc P-set in &omega;*, which may be treated as a (weak) partial answer to the question asking whether there are P-points in the random model.
<br>
<p>
This is a joint work with Piotr Borodulin-Nadzieja.

<strong>  29.03.2022, Tuesday 13.15, room 403</strong>
<br>
<strong>  Kacper Kucharski (MIM UW)</strong>
<p>
<strong> Using elementary submodels in topology</strong>  
<p>
<strong> Abstract:</strong> "The main goal of the talk is to present proofs of interesting
topological theorems using elementary submodels. One theorem will be the classical
Arhangel'skii's result which says that the cardinality of a compact Hausdorff
first countable space is at most the continuum.  The second part of the
talk will be focused on presenting  so-called
reflection results e.g., Dow's theorem: every nonmetrizable compact Hausdorff space contains a nonmetrizable subspace of cardinality &omega;<sub>1</sub>"

<br>
<strong>  Kamil Ryduchowski (MIM UW)</strong>
<p>
<strong> Elementary submodels and infinitary combinatorics</strong>  
<p>
<strong> Abstract:</strong> "We will present techniques of using elementary submodels as a tool in infinitary
combinatorics. We shall show  short, elegant proofs of, among others,
the Delta-system lemma, the pressing-down lemma, Erdos-Dushnik-Miller theorem."
<br>
<p>

<strong>  15.03.2022, Tuesday 13.15, room 403</strong>
<br>
<strong>  Jakub Andruszkiewicz (UW/IM PAN)</strong>
<p>
<strong> The club principle and its connections to the diamond principle</strong>  
<p>
<strong> Abstract:</strong> "The club principle was first introduced by Ostaszewski as a weakening of
the diamond principle, as it plays a crucial role in his original
construction of the Ostaszewski space. It is well-known that under CH
those principles are equivalent and we will present a proof of this
fact. We will also show by using an appropriate forcing extension that,
as proven by Shelah, assuming CH is essential, i.e. it is consistent
relative to ZFC that the club principle holds while the diamond principle
does not."

<strong>  8.03.2022, Tuesday 13.15, room 403</strong>
<br>
<strong>  Piotr Koszmider (IM PAN)</strong>
<p>
<strong> The Ostaszewski space</strong>  
<p>
<strong> Abstract:</strong> "We will present a construction of the classical Ostaszewski space. Like the construction of a Suslin tree, it is a paradigmatic construction which inspired
diamond based arguments in diverse applications."

<strong>Time and place:</strong> Tuesdays  13.15-15.00 pm,  room 403, &Sacute;niadeckich 8<p>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<p>


               <strong>The scope of the seminar: </strong>
Set-theoretic combinatorial and topological  methods in diverse fields of mathematics, 
with a special emphasis on abstract analysis like
  Banach spaces, Banach algebras, C*-algebras, Here we include both the developing of such methods as 
forcing, descriptive set theory, Ramsey theory as well as their concrete applications in the fields mentioned above.
<p>

<strong>Working group style: </strong> We will make efforts so that this seminar has
 more a working character rather than the presentation style. This means that we encourage long digressions,
 discussions, background preparations and participation of everyone. 
 We would like to immerse ourselves into the details of the mathematical arguments studied. 
Also the talks are usualy  devoted to research in progress or fascinating results leading to some project not yet resolved.
While ready final results could be presented at other seminars at IM PAN or UW.
