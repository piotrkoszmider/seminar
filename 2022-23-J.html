<strong>  Title: Colorings of uncountable squares, strong Luzin sets and partial orders. </strong>  
<p>
<strong> Abstract:</strong> "We will present classical multidimensional transfinite inductive arguments
leading under the continnum hypothesis to a strong Luzin set (Todorcevic) and to a c.c.c. partial order whose square
is not c.c.c. (Galvin). Both of these constructions are related to some colorings of pairs
of countable ordinals which found applications in algebra, analysis and topology (e.g., see Wednesday seminar this week). 
If time permits, we will discuss what happens after adding one or many Cohen reals."

<strong>  Kamil Ryduchowski   (UW/IMPAN)</strong>
<p>
<strong>  Title: On large free sets and L<sub>p</sub>(&mu;) spaces of large density</strong>  
<p>
<strong> Abstract:</strong> "The aim of the talk is to present a proof of the Enflo-Rosenthal theorem stating 
that Banach spaces of the form L<sub>p</sub>(&mu;) (where p&isin; (1,+&infin;), p&ne;2 
and &mu; is a finite measure) of the density dens(L<sub>p</sub>(&mu;))&ge; &aleph;<sub>&omega;</sub>
don't have unconditional bases. A combinatioral lemma similar to the
 Kuratowski's free set theorem is a crucial step in the proof.
  During the talk we will prove both of the aforementioned combinatorial results and proceed 
  to the proof of the Enflo-Rosenthal theorem. 
  The problem whether the assumption on the density of the space
   can be weakened to dens(L<sub>p</sub>(&mu;))&ge; &omega;<sub>1</sub>
  seems to be still open."

<p>
<strong>  A characterization of weak compactness in spaces of Radon measures.</strong>  
<p>
<strong> Abstract:</strong> "We will show a proof of the Dieudonne-Grothendieck theorem, which characterize 
relatively weakly compact subsets of Banach spaces of measures. The proof will be based on the 
Kadec-Pe&#322;czy&nacute;ski-Rosenthal subsequence splitting lemma,
 which says that every bounded sequence of measures admits a subsequence that may be expressed as the sum of two sequences: 
 one of them consists of measures with pairwise disjoint supports and constant norm, and the second one is weakly convergent."

<strong>  Piotr Koszmider   (IMPAN)</strong>
<p>
<strong>  Remarks on the Efimov problem, continuation.</strong>  
<p>
<strong> Abstract:</strong> "We will continue the talk of 3.11.
We will present a consistent example of an Efimov space. This will be the Stone space of P(N)&#8745;V
 after adding Sacks reals. We will also see that on the other hand  the Stone space of P(N)&#8745;V
 has nontrivial convergent sequences if there are Cohen reals over V.

<p>
<strong>  Topologies and subspaces of the space of measures, continuation.</strong>  
<p>
<strong> Abstract:</strong> "We will continue the talk of 10.11.
We will show two theorems left from 10.11 
that C(&beta;N) has the Grothendieck property (this strengthens the nonexistence of nontrivial
convergent sequences in &beta;N) and  the conditions equivalent  to the Grothendieck property
for C(K) spaces. This naturally  leads to considering the weak compactness 
in the space of measures  and its characterizations.

<strong>  Zden&#283;k Silber (IM PAN)</strong>
<p>
<strong>  On quotients of Grothendieck C(K) spaces, continuation.</strong>  
<p>
<strong> Abstract:</strong> "We continue the previous two talks  and focus on C(K) spaces which satisfy the Grothendieck property.
In the beginning we recall some notions related to sequential convergence in Banach spaces, namely
weakly Cauchy sequences, and convex block subsequences (which can be understood as a generalization
of the notion of a subsequence). Finally, we will use these notions to prove that consistently every
non-reflexive Grothendieck Banach space contains l<sub>1</sub>(2<sup>&omega;</sup>), and thus admits l<sub>&infin;</sub>
 as a quotient. This,
together with the result that non-Grothendieck C(K) spaces contain a complemented copy of c<sub>0</sub>, will
give us a dichotomy result about C(K) spaces."

<br>
<strong>  Piotr Koszmider   (IMPAN)</strong>
<p>
<strong>  Topologies and subspaces of the space of measures.</strong>  
<p>
<strong> Abstract:</strong> "We will discuss the usefullness of considering the weak topology
in the dual of a Banach space, in particular  for a space of the form C(K<sub>A</sub>), where K<sub>A</sub>
is the Stone space of a Boolean algebra A and of comparing it with the weak* topology. This naturally  leads to considering the weak compactness
 and to introducing the Grothendieck property. We will also discuss some aspects of the interplay
 between  compact spaces (or Boolean algebras) and the Banach spaces of continuous function defined on them.
 The talk should motivate some notions which will appear during the following talk by Zden&#283;k Silber
 on some dichotomy under Martin's axiom."

<strong>  Piotr Koszmider   (IMPAN)</strong>
<p>
<strong>  Remarks on the Efimov problem.</strong>  
<p>
<strong> Abstract:</strong> "The following is 
known as the Efimov problem: is there an infinite compact Hausdorff space which does not contain
a nontrivial convergent sequence and does not contain a copy of &beta;N? Such a space is called an Efimov space. Up till now there are
many consistent examples of Efimov spaces but no ZFC example has been constructed and no one proved the consistency of the nonexistence 
of them. In this talk we give a simple (but not elementary)
construction of an Efimov space using Sacks forcing and show some interesting sufficient conditions for a compact space to contain a copy of &beta;N
(based on the paper P. Koszmider, S. Shelah; 
Independent families in Boolean algebras with some separation properties. Algebra Universalis 2013)
<p>
The problem has a translation to Boolean algebras: "Is there an infinite  Boolean algebra without an independent family of cardinality continuum
and without an infinite countable Boolean homomorphic image?".  The Banach spaces version: "Is there an infinite dimensional 
 nonreflexive Banach space
whose quotients do not include spaces isomorphic to  c<sub>0</sub> nor l<sub>&infin;</sub>"
has been established as an undecidable problem (Talagrand, Haydon-Levy-Odell).
We plan to discuss these results."

<strong>  Damian G&#322;odkowski   (UW/IMPAN)</strong>
<p>
<strong>  Sums of Fredholm operators and strictly singular operators, continuation.</strong>  
<p>
<strong> Abstract:</strong> "Let X and Y be Banach spaces. We say that a bounded linear operator T: X ---> Y is Fredholm, if ker T and Y/TX are both finite-dimensional as vector spaces, and we define the index of T as i(T)=dim(ker T)- dim(Y/TX). I will show a classical result that if T: X ---> Y is Fredholm and S: X ---> Y is strictly singular (i.e. S is not an isomorphism when restricted to any infinite-dimensional subspace), then T+S is also Fredholm, and i(T+S)=i(T). We will illustrate the talk with natural examples concerning Banach spaces of the form C(K), where K is compact and Hausdorff. Some applications will be discussed as well."

<strong>Time and place:</strong> Thursdays  10.15-12.00 pm,  room 403, &Sacute;niadeckich 8<p>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<p>


               <strong>The scope of the seminar: </strong>
Set-theoretic combinatorial and topological  methods in diverse fields of mathematics, 
with a special emphasis on abstract analysis like
  Banach spaces, Banach algebras, C*-algebras, Here we include both the developing of such methods as 
forcing, descriptive set theory, Ramsey theory as well as their concrete applications in the fields mentioned above.
<p>

<strong>Working group style: </strong> We will make efforts so that this seminar has
 more a working character rather than the presentation style. This means that we encourage long digressions,
 discussions, background preparations and participation of everyone. 
 We would like to immerse ourselves into the details of the mathematical arguments studied. 
Also the talks are usualy  devoted to research in progress or fascinating results leading to some project not yet resolved.
While ready final results could be presented at other seminars at IM PAN or UW.
