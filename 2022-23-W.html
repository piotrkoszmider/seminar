<strong>  Title: Superatomic Boolean algebras and the structures they induce. </strong>  
<p>
<strong> Abstract:</strong> "We will review basics concerning superatomic Boolean algebras, scattered compact
spaces  and further combinatorial, topological and analytic structures they induce. In particular, I plan to construct a 
thin-tall superatomic Boolean algebra and discuss Baumgartner-Shelah construction of thin-very tall one as well
as mention the relations of these objects to Asplund Banach spaces and Radon-Nikodym compacta."

<p>
<strong>  Title:  Gaps in P(&omega;)/fin and their applications. Continuation.</strong>  
<p>
<strong> Abstract:</strong> " In this series of two talks, we will discuss the
(non)existence of certain types of gaps in the Boolean algebra P(&omega;)/fin.
Specifically, we will demonstrate that there are no (&kappa;, &lambda;) - gaps for &kappa;,
&lambda; &le; &omega;, and then construct a Hausdorff gap, i.e., an (&omega;<sub>1</sub>, &omega;<sub>1</sub>) - gap.
Additionally, we will present a characterisation of the bounding number
in terms of a Rothberger gap. Finally as an application, we will
use the Hausdorff gap to demonstrate the existence of a universal
measure zero set. All results mentioned above will be proven within ZFC.
In the end, we will also briefly discuss the notion of indestructible
gaps and describe the situation under PFA."

<strong>  Title:  An introduction to the combinatorics of 2-cardinals. Conclusion.</strong>  
<p>
<strong> Abstract:</strong> "This is the last of the series of talks devoted to present applications of 2-cardinals (versions of Velleman's neat simplified morasses) to combinatorics. We will use 2-cardinals to 
prove the existence of a version of the Hausdorff gap at level 
&kappa; (&kappa; is a regular cardinal) and use the coloring defined from 2-cardinals (a version of Todorcevic's &rho; function) to prove the existence of a &kappa;<sup>+</sup>-Aronszajn tree".

<p>
<strong>  Title:  An introduction to the combinatorics of 2-cardinals. Continuation.</strong>  
<p>
<strong> Abstract:</strong> "In this talk we will continue our study of 2-cardinals (versions of Velleman's simplified morasses). 
We will use them to define a certain
&kappa;-valued coloring on pairs of &kappa;<sup>+</sup> (&kappa; is a cardinal) and a family of functions from &kappa;<sup>+</sup> to {0,1,2} with interesting combinatorial properties, which we will use to construct a &kappa;-Kurepa tree 
and a version of the Hausdorff gap at the level of &kappa;".

<strong>  Kamil Ryduchowski (MIM UW/IM PAN) </strong>
<p>
<strong>  Title:  An introduction to the combinatorics of 2-cardinals.</strong>  
<p>
<strong> Abstract:</strong> "This is the first of two talks devoted to presenting the notion
 of a 2-cardinal (a version of Velleman's simplified morass) and its applications in infinitary combinatorics. Intuitively speaking, a 2-cardinal is a special family of subsets of &kappa;<sup>+</sup> (&kappa; is a cardinal), each
 of them of cardinality smaller than &kappa;, which can be used to transfinite inductive constructions of objects of size 
&kappa;<sup>+</sup> without dealing with the step of cofinality &kappa; in the process. 
In this talk we will present the definition of 2-cardinals, prove their basic properties
 and use them to construct a &kappa;-Kurepa tree and a version of the Hausdorff gap at the level of &kappa;"

<strong>  Zden&#283;k Silber (IM PAN) </strong>
<p>
<strong>  Title: On Corson's property (C) and other sequential properties.</strong>  
<p>
<strong> Abstract:</strong> "In this talk we introduce convex variants of topological properties
 like countable tightness, sequentiality, being Fr&eacute;chet-Urysohn or sequential compactness, 
 when applied to the dual ball of a Banach space equiped with the weak* topology.
  We will show some implications of those properties with a particular focus on 
  the equivalence (under PFA) of countable tightness and its convex variant, property (C)."

<strong>  Piotr Koszmider   (IMPAN)</strong>
<p>
<strong>  Title: Stepping-up with an Aronszajn tree and adding a Cohen real. Continuation.</strong>  
<p>
<strong> Abstract:</strong> "We will discuss classical techniques  involving almost coherent families of injections
from countable ordinals into &omega; and adding a Cohen real. Applications will include:
 adding one Cohen real to any model produces a coloring with the Galvin property, Suslin tree
and   an entangled set of reals etc."

<strong>  Krzysztof Zakrzewski   (MIMUW)</strong>
<p>
<strong>  Title: An elementary proof of the Eberlein-Smulian theorem. Continuation. </strong>  
<p>
<strong> Abstract:</strong> "We will give a brief proof of the Eberlein-Smulian theorem
which says that for a subset  of a Banach space endowed with the weak topology
three conditions are equivalent, namely: conditional compactness,
conditional sequential compactness and conditional countable
compactness. The proof will use standard results from theory of Banach
spaces, namely Alaoglu's theorem and the Hahn-Banach theorem.
<br>
The talk is based on the article "An Elementary Proof of
Eberlein-Smulian Theorem" by Robert Whitley (Math. Ann. 1967)"

<p>
<strong> Abstract:</strong> "We will discuss classical techniques involving almost coherent families of injections
from countable ordinals into &omega; and involving adding a Cohen real. Applications will include:
The existence of a strong Luzin set implies the existence of a coloring of pairs of &omega;<sub>1</sub>
with very strong multidimensional antiramsey properties; adding one Cohen real to any model produces a Suslin tree
and  produces an entangled set of reals etc."

<strong>Time and place:</strong> Tuesdays  10.15-12.00 pm,  room 403, &Sacute;niadeckich 8<p>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<p>


               <strong>The scope of the seminar: </strong>
Set-theoretic combinatorial and topological  methods in diverse fields of mathematics, 
with a special emphasis on abstract analysis like
  Banach spaces, Banach algebras, C*-algebras, Here we include both the developing of such methods as 
forcing, descriptive set theory, Ramsey theory as well as their concrete applications in the fields mentioned above.
<p>

<strong>Working group style: </strong> We will make efforts so that this seminar has
 more a working character rather than the presentation style. This means that we encourage long digressions,
 discussions, background preparations and participation of everyone. 
 We would like to immerse ourselves into the details of the mathematical arguments studied. 
Also the talks are usualy  devoted to research in progress or fascinating results leading to some project not yet resolved.
While ready final results could be presented at other seminars at IM PAN or UW.
