<strong> Measures with the Additive Property and the random forcing</strong>  
<p>
<strong> Abstract:</strong> "Let &mu; be a finitely additive probability measure on &omega; which vanishes on points, that is, &mu;({n})=0 for every n&isin;&omega;. It follows immediately that &mu; is not &sigma;-additive, however it may be almost &sigma;-additive in the following weak sense. We say that &mu; has the Additive Property, (AP) in short, if for every sequence (A<sub>n</sub>) of pairwise disjoint subsets of &omega; there is a subset A such that A<sub>n</sub>\A is finite for every n&isin;&omega; and &mu;(A)=&Sigma;<sub>n</sub> &mu;(A<sub>n</sub>). Equivalently, for every decreasing sequence (A<sub>n</sub>) of subsets of &omega; there is a subset A such that A\A<sub>n</sub> is finite for every n&isin;&omega; and &mu;(A)=lim<sub>n</sub> &mu;(A<sub>n</sub>). The latter definition implies immediately that, e.g., an ultrafilter U on &omega; is a P-point if and only if the one-point measure &delta;<sub>U</sub> has (AP). And similarly as in the case of P-points the existence of measures with (AP) is independent of ZFC.
<p>
During my talk I will discuss basic properties of (families of) measures with (AP) as well as show, at least briefly, that using old ideas of Solovay and Kunen one can obtain a non-atomic measure with (AP) in the random model. The latter result implies that in this model there exists a ccc P-set in &omega;*, which may be treated as a (weak) partial answer to the question asking whether there are P-points in the random model.

This is a joint work with Piotr Borodulin-Nadzieja."
